# Taxi Fare Prediction

This project focuses on predicting taxi fares based on several features using machine learning models.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict taxi fares accurately by leveraging machine learning algorithms. It involves the exploration of taxi trip data to identify patterns and features that significantly impact fare amounts.

## Dataset

- **Train Dataset**: Contains historical data of taxi trips, including fare amounts.
- **Test Dataset**: A dataset used for testing trained machine learning models.
- **Sample Dataset**: Provides a template for submitting predictions of fare amounts.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language used for data processing, analysis, and modeling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: For building and evaluating machine learning models.
- **XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest**: Implemented machine learning algorithms.

## Functionality Implemented

1. **Data Exploration**: Analyzed various features and their relationships with taxi fares.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and performed feature engineering.
3. **Model Building**: Employed machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest) to predict taxi fares.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluated models using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error, etc.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Improved model performance by tuning hyperparameters.

## Usage

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Refer to the Jupyter Notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for exploratory analysis and preprocessing steps.
2. **Model Development**: Explore the model development notebooks in `notebooks/` to understand the machine learning implementation.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Review the evaluation metrics and analysis in the notebooks.
4. **Prediction**: Use the trained model to predict fares on the test dataset or new data.
